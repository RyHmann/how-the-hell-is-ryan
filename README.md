A basic FLASK web application that answers all of the common questions I get asked as someone living abroad: What time is it there? What day is it? How's the weather?

This project is an excercise in using Flask as a back end platform, and making a mobile-first website, as all of my other sites seem to focus only on desktop resolutions.
